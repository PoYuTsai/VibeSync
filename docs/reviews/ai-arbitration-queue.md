# AI Arbitration Queue

> Purpose: a shared handoff + review + debate queue for Daisy, Claude, and Codex.
> Use this instead of free-form bot-to-bot chat.

## When To Use

Use this file when:

- Claude and Codex need a live handoff between work rounds
- Claude finished a DC / mobile-driven bugfix or partial feature and Codex may later review or continue it
- Codex finished a hardening / review pass and wants Claude to sanity-check product or UX impact
- Claude wants Codex to review a concrete bug, risk, or architecture tradeoff
- Codex wants Claude to sanity-check UI, product, or copy direction
- Daisy wants one place to see the current disagreement, evidence, and next action

Do not use this file for:

- ordinary commit summaries
- bug history
- ADRs that are already settled
- every tiny commit as a separate entry

Those still belong in `git log`, `docs/bug-log.md`, or `docs/decisions.md`.

## Ground Rules

1. One queue item = one decision or one concrete blocker.
2. One task keeps one live item. Update the existing item instead of appending a new one for every small round.
3. Newest open item goes on top.
4. Each side gets at most 2 rounds before escalating to Daisy.
5. Every claim about "safe", "faster", or "better" must cite evidence:
   - file path
   - commit hash
   - test result
   - benchmark
   - official doc
6. Product taste, UX preference, and business priority are Daisy-final.
7. No free-form bot loop:
   - Claude writes one structured position
   - Codex replies with one structured position
   - if still split, mark `Status: WAITING_ON_DAISY`
8. If the work is only a handoff and not a disagreement, still record:
   - latest commit
   - changed files or scope
   - tests run
   - open risks
   - next ask for the other agent
9. Keep only open items plus a few recently closed items. Once the durable record exists elsewhere, prune old closed entries.

## Status Values

- `OPEN`
- `IN_REVIEW`
- `WAITING_ON_DAISY`
- `CLOSED`

## Queue Template

Copy this block for each new item:

```md
## [YYYY-MM-DD] Short Title
Status: OPEN
Request-Type: handoff | review | arbitration
Raised-By: Claude | Codex | Daisy
Owner: Claude | Codex | Daisy
Scope: bug | review | architecture | product | copy | ops
Branch/Commit: `commit-hash` or `working-tree`

Question:
- What exact decision or blocker needs arbitration?

Context:
- Short factual setup only.

Changed:
- What changed in this round?

Evidence:
- [path-or-doc](../path.md) or `commit-hash`
- Test / runtime observation

Open-Risks:
- Pending

Claude-Position:
- Pending

Codex-Position:
- Pending

Verdict:
- Pending

Daisy-Decision:
- Pending

Action-Items:
- Pending

Close-Condition:
- What must happen before this item becomes CLOSED?
```

## Working Norms

- Claude should lead UI / Flutter / copy / product framing items.
- Codex should lead bugs / performance / architecture / code review items.
- If Claude is operating through Discord / mobile-driven sessions, update this file at the end of each meaningful round that Codex may later need to continue or review.
- If Codex finishes a pass and wants Claude to sanity-check it later, update the same item instead of opening a parallel summary.
- If Daisy asks for a recommendation, end with a single recommended path.
- If the issue becomes a lasting rule, move the final outcome into:
  - `docs/decisions.md` for ADR-level decisions
  - `docs/bug-log.md` for recurring bug traps
  - `AGENTS.md` only for short-lived operating rules
- This file is a live queue, not a changelog.
