# AI Arbitration Queue

## Status Values

- `OPEN`
- `IN_REVIEW`
- `WAITING_ON_ERIC`
- `APPROVED`
- `CLOSED`

## Rules

- One queue item = one decision, handoff, or blocker.
- Update the existing item instead of appending every tiny round.
- Claims about "safe", "better", or "fixed" need evidence: file path, commit, test/log, or runtime observation.
- Product taste and business priority are Eric-final.
- If the result becomes a durable rule, move it into `docs/shared-agent-rules.md`, `docs/bug-log.md`, or `docs/decisions.md`.

## Live Queue

## [2026-05-14] Dogfood Frontline Stabilization
Status: OPEN
Request-Type: handoff
Raised-By: Codex
Owner: Claude
Scope: bug / ops / review
Branch/Commit: `main` @ latest

Question:

- Eric and Bruce are dogfooding TestFlight. Claude/CC should handle first-line bug reports, while Codex provides read-only review for high-risk fixes.

Current Product Truth:

- Coach 1:1 is shipped into dogfood.
- Current phase is TestFlight dogfood / App Review stabilization.
- Do not treat archived roadmap labels or old planning tracks as current default work unless Eric explicitly asks.

Recent Context:

- Opener, paywall, quota, RevenueCat, and subscription sync have had repeated P0/P1 fixes.
- 2026-05-15 Eric accepted keeping the `restorePurchases()` paid-to-free snapshot guard during dogfood; do not "fix" it without an explicit new decision. See `docs/integrations/revenuecat.md`.
- 2026-05-15 auth/logout/delete-account local cleanup patches were reverted after repeated Codex `REVISE_REQUIRED` loops. Do not patch that scope again without a design/failure matrix.
- 2026-05-15 Support URL finding was closed by live evidence: `curl -I -L https://vibesyncai.app/support` returns 301 -> 200 OK.
- `!cc-rotate` is implemented for mobile session rotation.
- `!codex` Phase 1 is implemented as a read-only Discord review gate.
- WSL Codex CLI may still need one-time `codex login --device-auth`; verify with `!codex setup`.

High-Risk Areas:

- subscription / paywall / quota / RevenueCat / 429
- auth / account deletion / Hive persistence
- `analyze-chat` / opener / OCR / Edge response schema
- AI prompt changes affecting quality, safety, token/cost, or App Review stability

Operating Rules:

- If Bruce or Eric reports a bug, acknowledge the reporter and ask for missing repro details if needed.
- For screenshots: inspect and fix if repro is clear.
- For videos: ask for key screenshots, timestamps, expected vs actual, and steps before deep judgment.
- If Eric says "queue it", append the pending intake under this item instead of inventing root cause.
- After a high-risk hotfix commit/push, trigger Codex review before saying it is safe to build/test.

Evidence:

- `docs/snapshot.md`
- `docs/shared-agent-rules.md`
- `git log --oneline -30`
- `docs/bug-log.md` newest 2026-05 entries
- `tools/cc-rotate/README.md`
- `tools/codex-bridge/README.md`

Open Risks:

- RevenueCat sandbox and product mapping still need real-device matrix smoke after each paywall/subscription change.
- Free users must be able to use opener/analyze/coach until quota is actually exhausted.
- Opener/analyze must never show raw JSON.
- Format failure must not charge quota.
- Auth/logout/delete-account/local Hive isolation remains baseline behavior and needs design-first treatment before launch hardening.

Action Items:

- [ ] Keep first-line dogfood bug intake here when Eric is mobile.
- [ ] For high-risk fixes, run Codex review on the actual hotfix range, not blindly `latest`, and record the job/result.
- [ ] Close this item only after Eric says the current dogfood stabilization window is complete.

Close Condition:

- Eric confirms the current TestFlight dogfood bug wave is stable enough to move on.
